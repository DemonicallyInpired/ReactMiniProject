## Medify

Medify is a React-based web application that allows users to find medical centers in a specific state and city across the USA and book appointments

Some of the silent consideration and underpinning that one might come to understand while develping such project might includes the following:

- How to use a client side rendering library like react for developing dynamic user interfaces.
- The underlying construct of react in doing so such as the react lifecycles methods, hooks, optimisation consideration, preventing unecessary re-renders, etc.
- Perhaps specifying a state management stratey to manage complex stateful interaction without causing unecessary re-rendering resulting form prop drilling while still managing the
  relative complexity of the application as opposed to fiddling it with multiple context providers.
